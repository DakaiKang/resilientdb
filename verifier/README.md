# verifier
### TODO
1. Basic functionality (done)
2. Break up main (i.e. introduce subpackages) (done for some)
3. Implement request matching/verification prior to writes (i.e. only write upon getting f + 1 matching distinct requests) (done)
4. Eliminate most global variables by inroducing request handler types (done)
5. Improve Efficiency of Verification (ongoing)
6. Sync up Verifier with shim (maybe done)
7. Wrap types for application-specific context (maybe)
